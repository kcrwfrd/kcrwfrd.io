Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using **Next.js 16** with **MDX** support.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components directly in your content!

Here's what makes it powerful:

- **Write in Markdown**: Use the simple syntax you already know
- **Embed React Components**: Add interactive elements anywhere
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support
- **Fast**: Static generation with Next.js

## Code Example

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const slugs = getAllPostSlugs()
  return slugs.map((slug) => ({ slug }))
}
```

## Lists Work Great

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with **bold text**

### Ordered Lists

1. Install dependencies
2. Configure Next.js
3. Create your first post
4. Build and deploy

## Blockquotes

> MDX combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more content about web development, JavaScript, and building modern applications. Stay tuned for more posts!
